<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Dinny and I am from Aus. 
  I Love fishing, playing football and swiming especially, watching TV late at night. 
  Day dreaming is also a must to me, without it I can not simply function.</p>

  <p>During day time, I like to eat icecream. My favorites are fish, beef and pork.
    During night time, I like to learn coding as it is very important to me, because
    someday I would like to work as a professional hacker(haha), so i can hack my friend's website (:>}</p>

    <p>Lets keep hoping to that!!</p>
